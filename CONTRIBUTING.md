## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to functions
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions focused and short

**Example:**
```python
def calculate_sharpe_ratio(returns, risk_free_rate=0.02):
    """
    Calculate Sharpe ratio for a series of returns.
    
    Args:
        returns: List or array of returns
        risk_free_rate: Annual risk-free rate (default: 0.02)
    
    Returns:
        float: Sharpe ratio
    """
    excess_returns = returns - risk_free_rate
    return excess_returns.mean() / excess_returns.std()
```

### Testing

Before submitting:

1. **Test your changes**
   - Run backtest with multiple strategies
   - Test with different stocks and time periods
   - Verify position sizing works correctly

2. **Check edge cases**
   - Empty data
   - Single data point
   - Invalid inputs
   - Extreme values

3. **Verify existing functionality**
   - Make sure you didn't break anything
   - Test all strategies still work
   - Check plots still display

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

**Good:**
```
Add support for multiple position sizing methods
Fix bug where RSI strategy ignored upper threshold
Update documentation for custom strategy builder
```

**Bad:**
```
Fixed stuff
Update
Changes
```

### Documentation

When adding features:

1. **Update README.md** - Add to features list
2. **Update EXAMPLES.md** - Show how to use it
3. **Add docstrings** - Document new functions
4. **Update QUICKSTART.md** - If it affects quick start

## Adding New Strategies

To add a new strategy:

1. **Create strategy class**
```python
class MyNewStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    """Description of what this strategy does"""
    params = (
        ('param1', default_value),
    )
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize indicators
        pass
    
    def next(self):
        # Trading logic
        pass
```

2. **Add to STRATEGIES dictionary**
```python
STRATEGIES = {
    # ... existing strategies
    '12': {
        'name': 'My New Strategy',
        'class': MyNewStrategy,
        'description': 'Brief description'
    }
}
```

3. **Add to min_data_needed (if applicable)**
```python
min_data_needed = {
    # ... existing
    'MyNewStrategy': 30,  # Minimum data points needed
}
```

4. **Document it**
- Add to README.md strategy table
- Add example to EXAMPLES.md
- Add to QUICKSTART.md if appropriate

## Adding New Indicators

Custom indicators should follow backtrader's pattern:

```python
class MyIndicator(bt.Indicator):
    lines = ('signal',)
    params = (('period', 14),)
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Setup
        pass
    
    def next(self):
        # Calculate indicator value
        self.lines.signal[0] = calculation
```
